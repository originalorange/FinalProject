				<p>Over 95 years, The Commonwealth Fund has pursued its philanthropic mission through momentous events: world wars, depressions, presidential assassinations, civil rights movements, revolutions in technology and communication, the fall of the Berlin Wall, and the election of the first African American president.</p>
				<p>Still, within the context of U.S. health care history, 2013 has been an extraordinary time, one with major implications for the Fund and its mission to achieve a high performance health system. The Affordable Care Act-the most sweeping health reform in half a century-as been reshaping the health care landscape since 2010, but in 2013 the law became real for most Americans. That reality was complex, contentious, and often confusing. It also underlined the importance of the Fund's historical role in providing the kind of objective, relevant, and timely information needed to make sense of, and react to, the events of the day.</p>

			<h3>The number of people without health insurance in the United States climbed had steadily over the previous decade, rising from 37 million in 2000 to 50 million in 2010.</h3>
			<p>In 2011, however, the picture began to brighten, as the number of uninsured declined to 48.6 million people&mdash;the largest one-year drop in the past 10 years. This improvement was likely driven by an increase in the number of young adults who were enrolled in their parents' health plan, a direct result of one of the Affordable Care Act's first reforms.</p> 
			<p>The recent gains in coverage for young adults foreshadow the further progress expected once the law's major insurance provisions are fully implemented over the next few years. Millions of Americans will soon be able to enroll in private subsidized health plans offered through the new state insurance marketplaces, while others will become eligible for coverage through the Medicaid program. Many people will also benefit from a panoply of new insurance market reforms, including a new standard for essential health benefits and bans on insurers from charging people more based on health or gender or barring enrollment because of a preexisting health condition. In all, some 37 million Americans are expected to gain new or more affordable coverage over the next decade.</p> 
			<p>As enrollment in coverage through the marketplaces and Medicaid continues, The Commonwealth Fund's Health Care Coverage and Access program will furnish policymakers and key stakeholders with timely analysis to inform successful implementation. Activities will include:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Providing timely information about the ACA's reforms and the status of their implementation.</li>

				<li>Tracking enrollment and people's experiences with the new insurance options.</li>

				<li>Evaluating the effects of insurance reforms and state and federal innovation on the extent and quality of health coverage, access to health care, changes in employer-based coverage, affordability of premiums and out-of-pocket costs, health plan competition, innovation in insurance markets, and sustainability of the insurance marketplaces.</li>
				
				<li>Analyzing and developing national and state short-term policy solutions to address key issues as they arise.
				Identifying gaps in the law and its implementation that may leave some groups of people without coverage or adequate protection from costs.</li>
			</ul>

				<div class="program-subhead-dsr">HEALTH CARE DELIVERY SYSTEM REFORM</div>
				<h3>Health care in the United States is too often compromised by fragmentation in its delivery, by patients' limited access, and by spiraling costs. </h3>
				<p>Two groups of patients experience the problems in our health system more intensely and more regularly than any other: those with complex, long-term health care needs, and those with low income, often no health insurance, and few social supports. The Commonwealth Fund's new Health Care Delivery System Reform program focuses on these individuals, because they represent the greatest opportunity to achieve meaningful, rapid gains in the value of health care.</p> 
				<p>According to federal data, 5 percent of the U.S. population accounts for 50 percent of the nation's health care costs, and 10 percent accounts for 65 percent of total costs. High-cost patients include those with health-related functional limitations requiring not just medical care but frequently also long-term supports and services, such as individuals with multiple, serious chronic conditions like congestive heart failure, coronary artery disease, and diabetes.</p> 
				<p>People living in poverty and without health insurance coverage&ndash;a disproportionate number of whom are members of racial or ethnic minority groups&ndash;also experience our health system's shortcomings more acutely. Extensive research shows that economically and socially disadvantaged individuals have greater difficulty obtaining health care, receive lower-quality care, and have poorer health outcomes than other groups.</p>
				<p>By prioritizing complex and vulnerable patient populations, we as a nation can target our energy and resources where the impact will likely be greatest. Moreover, improvements in care and health for these patients can catalyze improvements throughout the entire health care delivery system.</p>
				<p>The goal of the Health Care Delivery System Reform program is to improve outcomes and lower costs for high-cost, complex and vulnerable patient populations. Work supported by the program will be governed by five strategies:</p>
				<ul>
					<li>Promoting care systems that coordinate medical care, long-term care services, and community-based resources.</li>
					<li>Reforming how providers are paid for their services to encourage more coordination, better quality, and greater efficiency.</li> 
					<li>Strengthening primary care.</li> 
					<li>Partnering with payers, particularly Medicare and Medicaid, and with private payers to test and spread effective innovations.</li> 
					<li>Developing the physician leadership needed to address the health needs of vulnerable populations through the <a href="http://www.commonwealthfund.org/grants-and-fellowships/fellowships/mongan-commonwealth-fund-fellowship">Mongan Commonwealth Fund Fellowship Program in Minority Health Policy.</a></li>

				<div class="program-subhead-ihp">INTERNATIONAL HEALTH POLICY AND PRACTICE INNOVATIONS</div>
				<h3>Across the globe, health care policymakers face mounting pressure to "bend the cost curve" while at the same time maintaining access to the latest in medical technologies, improving the quality and safety of care, and making the health system more responsive to patients' needs and preferences.</h3>
				<p>How other countries address these challenges should be of particular interest to the United States, which spends far more on health careeper person and as a percentage of the nation's economic output&mdash;than any other nation and yet receives less in return than most.</p>
				<p>The Commonwealth Fund's International Health Policy and Practice Innovations program is guided by the belief that despite differences in how countries organize and finance health care, the U.S. can learn a lot by examining other health systems, their performance in relation to ours, and their health care delivery and payment innovations&mdash;particularly those that we might consider adopting.</p>
				<p>To promote a robust international exchange of ideas, research, and experiences, the program's activities focus on:</p>
				<ul>
					<li>building an international network of health policy experts and leaders for cross-national research projects and sharing lessons learned;</li>
					<li>benchmarking U.S. health system performance against other high-income nations;</li>
					<li>providing a forum for high-level policy discussion and presenting effective international approaches to policy and care delivery;</li>
					<li>fostering transfer of effective innovations in health care delivery from other countries to the U.S.</li>
				</ul>

				<p>The international program's <a href="http://www.commonwealthfund.org/interactives-and-data/international-survey-data">annual surveys</a> of patients and clinicians in 11 high-income countries delve into financial barriers to care, chronic disease management, and satisfaction with the other topics. The annual International Symposium on Health Care provides health ministers, senior government officials, and leading policy thinkers with a rare opportunity to hear and discuss a range of viewpoints in an unscripted setting, while Capitol Hill briefings inform congressional and executive branch staff about the latest health policy developments. And the <a href="http://www.commonwealthfund.org/grants-and-fellowships/fellowships/harkness-fellowships">Harkness Fellowships in Health Policy and Practice</a> enable promising health care policy researchers and practitioners in 10 countries to spend up to a year in the U.S. conducting policy-oriented research under leading experts and gaining firsthand exposure to innovative models of health care delivery.</p>

				<div class="program-subhead-bop">BREAKTHROUGH HEALTH CARE OPPORTUNITIES</div>

				<h3>It's well documented that health care in the United States is not just expensive&ndash;it's world-class expensive, and unsustainably so. It's equally well documented that, on many levels, our health system doesn't measure up on a global scale; we're simply not getting what we pay for.</h3>
				<p>Clearly, it's going to take more than minor tweaks or adjustments to change our course. It's going to take a real breakthrough.</p>
				<p>The Commonwealth Fund's new Breakthrough Health Care Opportunities program aims to discover and vet transformative ideas that have the potential to expand access to care, dramatically simplify the delivery of care, decrease costs, and improve health outcomes. The program also seeks to "grease the wheels” of the development cycle so that breakthroughs can realize their potential.</p>
				<p>What do we mean by a breakthrough? Though incremental change is valuable, and The Commonwealth Fund pursues this in many of its other programs, that's not what we're looking for here. We mean an idea, paradigm, or strategy that positively and profoundly disrupts the status quo.</p>
				<p>Whether there have been real breakthroughs in health care delivery is open for debate. The good news is there is no shortage of innovative ideas and&ndash;thanks to modern social networks&ndash;no limits on the flow of information. But with so many ideas in circulation, the task is to identify which ones have the highest probability of achieving breakthrough impact, and then to generate prototypes and investment models that take us rapidly from concept to reality.</p>
				<p>The Breakthrough Health Care Opportunities program is exploring emerging technologies, care delivery processes, organizational models, incentives, and policies with a potentially game-changing effect on health system performance. By bringing together innovators, users, entrepreneurs, venture capitalists and regulators, the program is beginning to facilitate the translation of these innovative ideas into practice.</p>
				<p>Currently the program focuses on three areas:</p>
				<ul>
					<li>Engaging consumers in their health care through information technology.</li>
					<li>The next generation of provider incentives, many grounded in behavioral change theory.</li>
					<li>Developing bundles of innovations whose synergy can lead to transformative change on a large scale.</li>
				</ul>

			<div class="programs-body">
				<div class="program-subhead-costs">CONTROLLING HEALTH CARE COSTS</div>
				<h3>The U.S. health care system is by far the most expensive in the world, consuming 17 percent of the nation's gross domestic product. That's 50 percent higher than the share of GDP devoted to health care in the second-most-expensive country (the Netherlands) and nearly double that in many other high-income countries.</h3>
				<p>Despite all that spending, health outcomes for Americans are often worse, while evidence of waste and inefficiency throughout the U.S. health system abounds. Evidence also shows that U.S. prices are out of line with what other developed nations pay for the same medical services, devices, and pharmaceuticals&mdash;even those produced in the United States sold on global markets. All this excess spending is putting a strain on businesses, governments, and household budgets&mdash;diverting resources away from investments in jobs, education, and other social and economic needs.</p>
				<p>The Commonwealth Fund's Controlling Health Costs initiative monitors and analyzes spending in both the public and private health care sectors. It seeks answers to two central questions:</p>
				<ul>
					<li>What is driving higher or lower costs and spending in health care markets across the country?</li>
					<li>What policy reforms, innovations in care delivery, or changes in provider payment have the potential to reduce costs while improving outcomes in all regions?</li>
				</ul>
				<p>Patients with the highest and costliest health care needs, such as people with multiple chronic conditions, are a particular emphasis of the initiative. Research efforts also focus on the cost impact of new medical technologies and changing demographics, as well as the role of prices, the structure of health care markets, treatment patterns, and resource use.</p>
				<p>By exploring evidence-based approaches to controlling costs, The Commonwealth Fund is contributing to the push for a health care system focused on value.</p>

				<p>The Commonwealth Fund's Board of Directors comprises a diverse group of health care leaders and policy and financial experts. It has fiduciary responsibility for the foundation and is charged with ensuring its accountability and effective pursuit of mission.</p>
				<p>Throughout the foundation's history, the Board has been a policy-setting body, with responsibility for overseeing the overall mission, hiring and assessing the performance of the president, advising on and approving program strategies and spending policy, guiding the management of the Fund's endowment, and assessing the performance of the institution.</p>
				<h5>Benjamin Chu, M.D. Is Elected Chair as James Tallon Jr. Retires from Fund Board </h5>
				<p>Benjamin Chu, M.D. a Commonwealth Fund board member since 2003, was elected chairman in November, succeeding James Tallon Jr., president of the United Hospital Fund of New York (UHF). Dr. Chu, group president of Kaiser Foundation Health Plan and Hospitals in Southern California and Georgia, joined the Kaiser Foundation Health Plan in 2005 and previously served as president of the New York City Health and Hospitals Corporation (HHC), senior associate dean of Columbia University College of Physicians and Surgeons (affiliated with Harlem Hospital), and vice president for clinical affairs and associate dean at New York University Medical Center. While serving as HHC's senior vice president for medical and professional affairs, he also was acting commissioner of health for New York City and acting director for Kings County Hospital Center. Dr. Chu is the immediate past chair of The American Hospital Association's Board of Trustees.</p>
				<p>James Tallon Jr. retired from the Fund's Board in November after 18 years of service, including seven as chair. He is nationally recognized for his leadership in health policy, both as president of the UHF, the nation's oldest federated charity addressing critical issues affecting health care in New York City, for the past 21 years, and as a member of the New York State Assembly for 19 years. A member of the New York State Board of Regents, Mr. Tallon has served on numerous other boards and commissions, including as chair of the Kaiser Commission on Medicaid and the Uninsured and as secretary and treasurer of the Alliance for Health Reform. During his tenure as chair, David Blumenthal, M.D., was appointed as the Fund's seventh president.
				The Fund has benefited tremendously from the commitment and support of Mr. Tallon and the ability to bring on Dr. Chu as the new chair to lead the board. Commenting on the transition, Mr. Tallon said, "Ben's experience as a clinician and a strategic leader in public and private health care delivery and administration will be an invaluable asset to the Fund.”</p>

				<h5>Drs. Mitchell Blutt and Mark Smith Elected to Board</h5>
				<p>Two new Fund Board members were elected in 2014: Mitchell Blutt, M.D., in July, and Mark Smith, M.D., in November.</p>
				<p>Mitchell Blutt is the founder and chief executive officer of the healthcare investment firm Consonance Capital. Prior to founding Consonance, he was an executive partner of J.P. Morgan Partners. He is also a clinical assistant professor of medicine in the Department of Medicine at Weill Cornell Medical College and the Graduate School of Medical Sciences of Cornell University. He is a member of the New York Academy of Medicine and has served on multiple boards and has been a trustee of the University of Pennsylvania and Penn Medicine, its medical school and health system.</p>
				<p>Mark Smith was the founding president and chief executive officer of the California HealthCare Foundation, where he served from 1996 to 2013. A board certified internist, he is a member of the clinical faculty of the University of California, San Francisco, and an attending physician at the Positive Health program for AIDS care at the San Francisco General Hospital. Prior to joining the California HealthCare Foundation, he was executive vice president at the Henry J. Kaiser Family Foundation. He currently serves on the board of the Institute for Healthcare Improvement and is a member of the institute of Medicine.</p>
				<p>The Fund is fortunate to be able to bring on two new directors with deep experience in different areas of health care: in medicine and health care finance and investments in the case of Mitchell Blutt and in the health care needs of vulnerable populations in the case of Mark Smith.</p>
				<h5>Executive Vice President John E. Craig and Senior Vice President Cathy Schoen Step Down</h5>
				<p>The Fund's EVP and Chief Operating Officer John Craig retired at the end of 2014. John Craig has served the Fund since 1981 and has had a profound impact on the Fund and its growth and development institutionally and in the field of philanthropy. In his three decades at the Fund he has worked closely with three of the Fund's seven presidents, overseen the endowment that has more than quintupled since his arrival, and has developed systems to increase the effectiveness of the Fund's grantmaking , the efficiency and transparency of its operations and the Commonwealth Fund's impact in the world.   Prior to joining the Fund, he had an impressive and varied career, which included service as a Foreign service reserve officer in Vietnam, as an economic advisor to several Asian and African countries during his tenure with the U.S. Agency for International Development and in designing health policy research programs for the Georgetown University School of Medicine, the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation and the John A. Hartford Foundation.</p>
				<p>In addition to his duties at the Fund John has been a critical contributor to multiple philanthropic entities, including chairing the Nonprofit Coordinating Committee of New York City, serving on the board of the International Women's Health Coalition and the TIFF Education Foundation. He also chaired the board of The Investment Fund for Foundations during a formative period.</p>    
				<p>His intellect, tireless work, judgement and integrity as well as kindness and humanity are the hallmarks of his legacy at the Fund. Commenting on his retirement, Fund president David Blumenthal remarked, "It is no exaggeration to say that John will be leaving the Fund at the absolute pinnacle of his success, as defined not only by his performance on behalf of the institution he has served for more than three decades, but also by his many and continuing contributions to the not for profit and philanthropic world."</p>
				<h5>Cathy Schoen, Senior Vice President for Policy, Research and Evaluation stepped down in June after nearly 20 years at the Fund.</h5> 
				<p>Cathy was a member of the Fund's executive management team since 2005 and served as the research director for the Fund's landmark Commission on a High Performance Health System. From 1998 to 2005 she directed the Fund's Task Force on the Future of Health Insurance and she launched and oversaw the Fund's scorecard activities which have contributed significantly to the understanding of the variability in the country's health care system and the potential to improve.  Prior to joining the fund, Cathy taught health economics and directed the Service Employee International Union's   policy and research department and served as staff for President Carter's national health insurance task force.   Former Fund president Karen Davis noted, "Cathy is largely responsible for the Fund's outstanding reputation as a source of timely, important, reliable and policy relevant information. The Fund would not be what it is without the dedication, hard work and immense talent that she brought to her work."</p>
				<p>The Fund is deeply grateful for the contributions of these two long tenured senior staff members and wishes them well in their next stage of life.</p>
