<h4>Directors and Staff</h4>
<p>The Commonwealth Fund's Board of Directors comprises a diverse group of health care leaders and policy and financial experts. It has fiduciary responsibility for the foundation and is charged with ensuring its accountability and effective pursuit of mission.</p>
<p>Throughout the foundation's history, the Board has been a policy-setting body, with responsibility for overseeing the overall mission, hiring and assessing the performance of the president, advising on and approving program strategies and spending policy, guiding the management of the Fund's endowment, and assessing the performance of the institution.</p>
<h5>Benjamin Chu, M.D. Is Elected Chair as James Tallon Jr. Retires from Fund Board </h5>
<p>Benjamin Chu, M.D. a Commonwealth Fund board member since 2003, was elected chairman in November, succeeding James Tallon Jr., president of the United Hospital Fund of New York (UHF). Dr. Chu, group president of Kaiser Foundation Health Plan and Hospitals in Southern California and Georgia, joined the Kaiser Foundation Health Plan in 2005 and previously served as president of the New York City Health and Hospitals Corporation (HHC), senior associate dean of Columbia University College of Physicians and Surgeons (affiliated with Harlem Hospital), and vice president for clinical affairs and associate dean at New York University Medical Center. While serving as HHC's senior vice president for medical and professional affairs, he also was acting commissioner of health for New York City and acting director for Kings County Hospital Center. Dr. Chu is the immediate past chair of The American Hospital Association's Board of Trustees.</p>
<p>James Tallon Jr. retired from the Fund's Board in November after 18 years of service, including seven as chair. He is nationally recognized for his leadership in health policy, both as president of the UHF, the nation's oldest federated charity addressing critical issues affecting health care in New York City, for the past 21 years, and as a member of the New York State Assembly for 19 years. A member of the New York State Board of Regents, Mr. Tallon has served on numerous other boards and commissions, including as chair of the Kaiser Commission on Medicaid and the Uninsured and as secretary and treasurer of the Alliance for Health Reform. During his tenure as chair, David Blumenthal, M.D., was appointed as the Fund's seventh president.
The Fund has benefited tremendously from the commitment and support of Mr. Tallon and the ability to bring on Dr. Chu as the new chair to lead the board. Commenting on the transition, Mr. Tallon said, “Ben's experience as a clinician and a strategic leader in public and private health care delivery and administration will be an invaluable asset to the Fund.”</p>

<h5>Drs. Mitchell Blutt and Mark Smith Elected to Board</h5>
<p>Two new Fund Board members were elected in 2014: Mitchell Blutt, M.D., in July, and Mark Smith, M.D., in November.</p>
<p>Mitchell Blutt is the founder and chief executive officer of the healthcare investment firm Consonance Capital. Prior to founding Consonance, he was an executive partner of J.P. Morgan Partners. He is also a clinical assistant professor of medicine in the Department of Medicine at Weill Cornell Medical College and the Graduate School of Medical Sciences of Cornell University. He is a member of the New York Academy of Medicine and has served on multiple boards and has been a trustee of the University of Pennsylvania and Penn Medicine, its medical school and health system.</p>
<p>Mark Smith was the founding president and chief executive officer of the California HealthCare Foundation, where he served from 1996 to 2013. A board certified internist, he is a member of the clinical faculty of the University of California, San Francisco, and an attending physician at the Positive Health program for AIDS care at the San Francisco General Hospital. Prior to joining the California HealthCare Foundation, he was executive vice president at the Henry J. Kaiser Family Foundation. He currently serves on the board of the Institute for Healthcare Improvement and is a member of the institute of Medicine.</p>
<p>The Fund is fortunate to be able to bring on two new directors with deep experience in different areas of health care: in medicine and health care finance and investments in the case of Mitchell Blutt and in the health care needs of vulnerable populations in the case of Mark Smith.</p>
<h5>Executive Vice President John E. Craig and Senior Vice President Cathy Schoen Step Down</h5>
<p>The Fund's EVP and Chief Operating Officer John Craig retired at the end of 2014. John Craig has served the Fund since 1981 and has had a profound impact on the Fund and its growth and development institutionally and in the field of philanthropy. In his three decades at the Fund he has worked closely with three of the Fund's seven presidents, overseen the endowment that has more than quintupled since his arrival, and has developed systems to increase the effectiveness of the Fund's grantmaking , the efficiency and transparency of its operations and the Commonwealth Fund's impact in the world.   Prior to joining the Fund, he had an impressive and varied career, which included service as a Foreign service reserve officer in Vietnam, as an economic advisor to several Asian and African countries during his tenure with the U.S. Agency for International Development and in designing health policy research programs for the Georgetown University School of Medicine, the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation and the John A. Hartford Foundation.</p>
<p>In addition to his duties at the Fund John has been a critical contributor to multiple philanthropic entities, including chairing the Nonprofit Coordinating Committee of New York City, serving on the board of the International Women's Health Coalition and the TIFF Education Foundation. He also chaired the board of The Investment Fund for Foundations during a formative period.</p>    
<p>His intellect, tireless work, judgement and integrity as well as kindness and humanity are the hallmarks of his legacy at the Fund.  Commenting on his retirement, Fund president David Blumenthal remarked, “ It is no exaggeration to say that John will be leaving the Fund at the absolute pinnacle of his success, as defined not only by his performance on behalf of the institution he has served for more than three decades, but also by his many and continuing contributions to the not for profit and philanthropic world.”
Cathy Schoen, Senior Vice President for Policy, Research and Evaluation stepped down in June after nearly 20 years at the Fund. Cathy was a member of the Fund's executive management team since 2005 and served as the research director for the Fund's landmark Commission on a High Performance Health System. From 1998 to 2005 she directed the Fund's Task Force on the Future of Health Insurance and she launched and oversaw the Fund's scorecard activities which have contributed significantly to the understanding of the variability in the country's health care system and the potential to improve.  Prior to joining the fund, Cathy taught health economics and directed the Service Employee International Union's   policy and research department and served as staff for President Carter's national health insurance task force.   Former Fund president Karen Davis noted, “ Cathy is largely responsible for the Fund's outstanding reputation as a source of timely, important, reliable and policy relevant information. The Fund would not be what it is without the dedication, hard work and immense talent that she brought to her work. ”
The Fund is deeply grateful for the contributions of these two long tenured senior staff members and wishes them well in their next stage of life.</p>
