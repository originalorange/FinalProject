			<p>Over 95 years, The Commonwealth Fund has pursued its philanthropic mission through momentous events: world wars, depressions, presidential assassinations, civil rights movements, revolutions in technology and communication, the fall of the Berlin Wall, and the election of the first African American president.</P>
			<p>Still, within the context of U.S. health care history, 2013 has been an extraordinary time, one with major implications for the Fund and its mission to achieve a high performance health system. The Affordable Care Act&mdash;the most sweeping health reform in half a century&mdash;has been reshaping the health care landscape since 2010, but in 2013  the law became real for most Americans. That reality was complex, contentious, and often confusing. It also underlined the importance of the Fund's historical role in providing the kind of objective, relevant, and timely information needed to make sense of, and react to, the events of the day.</P>
			<p>To grapple with the historic health care changes, The Commonwealth Fund last summer undertook a review of its programs. The exercise confirmed the value of many ongoing projects. But it also led us to adopt some new directions. For the near future, the Fund has organized its work around four themes and a series of cross-cutting and supporting activities.</P>
			<p>First, the Fund will promote efforts to make affordable health insurance coverage and access to care available to more Americans. In the short term, we will continue to monitor implementation of the Affordable Care Act's coverage provisions. With Sara Collins's expertise and leadership, the Fund's Health Care Coverage and Access program has already produced important analyses of the law's reforms to the individual and small-group insurance markets and the expansion of affordable, comprehensive health coverage for previously uninsured Americans. The Fund's health reform tracking surveys, meanwhile, are examining consumers' experiences with purchasing coverage in the new online marketplaces. And a recent Fund study assessed the financial implications for states rejecting new federal funds for expanding Medicaid eligibility.</P>
			<p>A second focus area for The Commonwealth Fund will be health care delivery system reform. Led by the team of Melinda Abrams, Anne-Marie Audet, Pamela Riley, Mark Zezza, and Stuart Guterman, this work will focus on improving health system performance for two critical groups in our society: high-need, high-cost patients, and vulnerable populations. The first group comprises the individuals who consume the bulk of resources in our incredibly costly and inefficient health system&mdash;particularly people with multiple chronic and complex conditions&mdash;and who suffer disproportionately from its quality and safety problems. Raising health system performance should logically start with efforts to obtain greater value for the health care dollars devoted to the care of this population. The second group, consisting of disadvantaged ethnic and racial minorities and people with low incomes, has been a central concern of the Fund for decades and will continue to be in the future.</P>
			<p>A third focus is international health policy and practice&mdash;a vital area of activity, ably led by Robin Osborn. The Commonwealth Fund provides a unique service within the United States and abroad in generating objective, comparative cross-national data on health system performance. Our analyses will not only continue to highlight areas where the U.S. health system underperforms, but they will also assess progress made possible by the Affordable Care Act. In addition, the international program will undertake efforts to identify models of care delivery in other countries that are potentially transferable to the U.S. and could improve health care here at home. We are hypothesizing that the ACA reforms will create a receptivity for these models that previously did not exist.</P>
			<p>A fourth, and, for the Fund, quite new area of emphasis will be what we are calling "breakthrough health care opportunities." The aim is to identify, assess, and, where appropriate, promote ideas and innovations that have the potential to profoundly disrupt health system behavior in positive ways. While this experimental initiative represents quite a departure for the Fund, we are confident it will yield stimulating new perspective on all our work. Anne-Marie Audet, who is leading the team, has assembled a terrific advisory group to help us design the program and the surveillance capacity needed to alert us to potential breakthroughs in health care.</P>
			<p>Complementing and supporting the Fund's efforts within these four areas will be our continued cross-cutting work on cost control and Medicare, as well as our activities in health system performance tracking, state and federal policymaker outreach, and communications. Our cost-control work will be informed by a new advisory group that we have dubbed our "council of economic advisors"&mdash;leading health economists who will help identify promising avenues for controlling health care costs. Cathy Schoen and Stuart Guterman are leading this effort. Stu is also directing our continuing work to inform debate about the future of Medicare, which is deeply affected by the Affordable Care Act and will remain critical to the health of more than 40 million Americans.</P>
			<p>Douglas McCarthy and David Radley will direct our signature series of "<a href="http://www.commonwealthfund.org/Publications/Health-System-Scorecards.aspx">scorecards</a>" for tracking health system performance, while Rachel Nuzum will lead our outreach to state and federal decision-makers, including our bipartisan congressional retreat and our regular briefings for congressional staff. Barry Scholl will continue to direct our excellent work in communications, with new efforts planned to use social media tools to inform and educate key audiences. Michelle Doty is leading a comprehensive update of the Fund's internal tracking and evaluation methods. Finally, we are pleased to note that in January 2014, Donald Moulds, currently Acting Assistant Secretary for Planning and Evaluation in the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, will join the Fund as Executive Vice President for Programs and will play a major role in directing all these activities, new and continuing.</P>
			<p>This exciting and ambitious agenda has energized The Commonwealth Fund for the challenging period in health care that lies ahead. We are fortunate to have the support of a terrific board of directors and wonderful staff (of whom I could cite only a handful here). As we enter 2014, we will be pursuing our mission to achieve a high-performing health system with renewed vigor. And, as always, we welcome your input to help us be as effective as we can in that quest.</P>
